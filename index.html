		<p>I am a student at UNCC Coding Bootcamp, at the very beginning of a brand new path for my life. Previously I have worked in the restaurant industry, and in real estate. My current areas of expertise are in food, wine, and the housing market. I have taken up kite surfing as a hobby, and like to island hop in the Caribbean.</p>
		<p>I have a four year old son who loves gaming, and has been the cause of my interest in how these games are created. I looked into coding, and a whole realm of possibilities has opened up for me. </p>
