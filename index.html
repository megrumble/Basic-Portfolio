                <p><img src="assets/images/head shot.jpg" alt="Head Shot Photo" id="headshot"> I am a student at UNCC Coding Bootcamp, at the very beginning of a brand new path for my life. Previously I have worked in the restaurant industry, and in real estate. My current areas of expertise are in food, wine, and the housing market. I have taken up kite surfing as a hobby, and like to island hop in the Caribbean.
                    <br> I have a four year old son who loves gaming, and has been the cause of my interest in how these games are created. I looked into coding, and a whole realm of possibilities has opened up for me.
                    <br> In my spare time I am Princess Peach, and my special ability is floating. </p>
